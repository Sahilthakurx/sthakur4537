        <p><b>BHAGAT SINGH</b> <small>&lt;28 September 1907 &hyphen; 23 March 1931&gt;</small> was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail&comma; which&hyphen;on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian&hyphen;owned newspapers&hyphen;turned him into a household name in the Punjab region and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and <i>folk hero in Northern India.</i> Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism&comma; he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s&comma; and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress&apos;s nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India&apos;s Independence.</p>
